This is a portfolio of my computer science work. The code is my own, except where indicated. 
There are individual readme's accompanying each project to describe them in more detail and comments in the code, should you peruse it. The quality and quantity of my commenting has improved as I've grown older and more experienced, so many of the comments in my early code were added after the fact. 

I regret that I cannot often add much to this portfolio. I have kept busy, but the most interesting code I've written is not mine to share freely. My personal projects are either so small as to be trivial or unfinished to the extent that I would be ashamed to include them here. 

My most recent (in fact, the only recent) addition is some code for an arduino project that monitors the temperature of a thermistor (in my case, stuck into a freezer). The readme provides more details of that story.
The Python code included deomonstrates my interest my early interest in coding and cryptography.
The Swift code, despite being amateur and full of inefficiencies, shows my dedication to detail and willingness to see projects through. Also, it was actually fun to play the final product.
