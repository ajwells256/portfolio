This is a portfolio of my computer science work. The code is my own, except where indicated. 
There are individual readme's accompanying each project to describe them in more detail and comments in the code, should you peruse it. The quality and quantity of my commenting has improved as I've grown older and more experienced, so many of the comments in my early code were added after the fact. 

I regret that I cannot often add much to this portfolio. I have kept busy, but the most interesting code I've written is not mine to share freely. My personal projects are either so small as to be trivial or unfinished to the extent that I would be ashamed to include them here. 

The Python code is simplistic to the point where I'd like to remove it, but it shows my interest my early interest in coding and cryptography.
I'm most satisfied with the Swift code; despite being amateur and full of inefficiencies, it shows dedication and a wonderfully interesting final product.
