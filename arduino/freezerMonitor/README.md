This project came about because I had a sneaking suspicion that my fridge was thawing rapidly and often, to a potentially dangerous degree. The original setup was thrown together, and included a raspberry pi to read and save thermistor data.

But that was too simple and inefficient, so I returned to the problem when I suspected the problem had come back serveral months later (after our landlord had fixed it). This time, I intend to do without the raspberry pi, clean up the wiring, add some additional signaling, but retain the data collection capacity. This is a work in progress!
